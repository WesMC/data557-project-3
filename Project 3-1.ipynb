    "# Project 3: Predicting Winners in Soccer Matches\n",
    "\n",
    "Predicting the outcome of a sporting event is a challenging task, so much so that an entire industry exists to relieve  those who believe they can do so of their money. Despite the challenging nature of the task, there are a few people who manage to make their living (and a very good living at that!) making predictions and betting on the outcomes. Your job is to try your hand at this with a basic model.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Data\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project, you are going to use a large *relational database* of publicly available information on European soccer matches that is available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/hugomathien/soccer/kernels). This database is a SQLite database. A relational database is a data structure which contains several related tables, where each table is similar to a dataframe. There are a couple of advantages to having the data in a database: for one thing, you can 'peek' at the data without loading it all into memory. Also, databases tend to be strongly typed, so that you always know the type of data that is loaded in each column (though actually SQLite is much looser in this regard than other database software). \n",
    "\n",
    "## The Objective(s)\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, you will tag every match with a 1 for home team win or draw and a 0 for away team win. Your goal is to build a model to predict whether the game is a home team win or draw or an away team win. You must:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Explore the dataset. What appears to correlate with home team wins/losses? What is missing?\n",
    "2. Separate the data into a set for training (building the model) and testing. The test set size should not be more than 20% of the full dataset.\n",
    "3. Build a model to predict who wins. To determine the quality of the model, assess the model by calculating the accuracy. You can write a function to do this or use scikit-learn's `accuracy_score`, which is in the `metrics` submodule.\n",
    "4. Build a couple of different models (creating a different model means using a different set of predictor variables). Which performs the best on the held-out testing dataset? Bonus points for creativity and thoroughness! You must create and test a minimum of three different models for full credit.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Teams\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Evan Royer, Briana Garcia (Durham)\n",
    "2. Evan O'Reilly, Jacob Mechaber (Durham)\n",
    "3. Patrick Donovan, Kelvin Nguyen, Robert Patenaude\n",
    "4. Aaron Broady, Andrew Meyer, Wesley Couturier, Ryan Kiessling\n",
    "5. Angus Jameson, Danielle LeBoeuf, Craig Vignault \n",
    "6. Brent Groden, Stephen McCarter, Aurora VanDeWater\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider using Git/Github to share and manage your work!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Due Date\n",
    "\n",
    "Due by Tuesday, May 2, 3:39 PM. Submit as an HTML file on myCourses.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Final Thoughts\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an extremely challenging prediction task. To get a sense of how hard it is, start by making a couple absolutely dumb baseline models: predicting always home team wins, for instance, or predicting wins entirely at random. Measure the accuracy of these models. As you develop more sophisticated models, refer back to these dumb ones. Did your model do better?\n",
    "\n",
    "This database has been explored quite a bit on [kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com). Feel free to use what you see there."
